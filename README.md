# quick-sort
This project implements the Quick Sort Algorithm.  The sorting algorithm is implemented recursively on an array of numbers
around a pivot point.  The Python version allows the user to select between pivot points:  first, last, median.

Running either the C++ version or the Python version without arguments will produce results for imbedded test vectors.
The Python version has command line options that allow for reading in test vectors from a file.
